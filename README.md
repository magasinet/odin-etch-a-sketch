# odin-etch-a-sketch

About project:

Draw something with the mousepad hovering on a "sketchpad". The sketchpad consist of squares that changes color when mouseover. Change number of squares to change the sketchpad.

Skills used:

Focus on DOM manipulation. Created sketchpad by adding div squares through a loop. Added eventlistener to the div squares (mouseover) that changes the background color and creates an image. Used Mutation Over for the first time, which get triggered when the Nodelist changes.
